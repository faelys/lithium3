-- Natools.Web.Simple_Pages.Markdown_Multipages extends the markdown_page   --
-- idea by gather several related pages into a single file, separated by    --
-- boundary lines containing only alternating '+' and '-'.                  --
-- Unlike Markdown_Pages where the leading atom is ignored, here it is used --
-- to override the path rendered in templated ("Web_Path") and/or the path  --
-- under which the simple page is regesterd ("Key_Path"), according to the  --
-- following syntax:                                                        --
--  * an atom with a leading '+' has both Web_Path and Key_Path as the      --
--    root multipage path followed by the suffix after '+',                 --
--  * an atom with a leading '-' has the Web_Path overridden by the suffix  --
--    after '-' and is not registerd as responding to any path in the site, --
--  * an atom with a leading '#' has the Web_Path of the root multipage     --
--    followed by the suffix after '#' and is not registered in the site,   --
--  * other atoms override both the Web_Path and the Key_Path.              --
-- So for example, a bunch of pages can be simply merged using unprefixed   --
-- atoms. A page made of several subcomponents that don't have any          --
-- dedicated path but behave as self-contained entities in the rendering    --
-- system can be made with the index page marked as "+" (with an empty      --
-- suffix), and subcomponents as "#subanchor" so that they Web_Path still   --
-- points to the relevant subcomponent.                                     --
