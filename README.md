`lithium` is the name I give to the CMS-ish web application that powers my
personal website, currently at <http://instinctive.eu/>. This is the third
rewrite from scratch, hence the name `lithium3`.

Its mostly a straightforward use of the components I gathered in the library
called `natools-web`. It also depends on my projects `ada-syslog` for logging
and `markup-ada` for Markdown rendering.

Looking at it from the other way around, `lithium3` is probably of the
simplest possible real-world example application of `natools-web` and also
of `markup-ada` taken as an Ada library.
